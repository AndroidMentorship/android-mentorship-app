The first thing that I think is very important is to deal with the User interface of the game.
I suggest we have two separate views the first one should serve as the one that will show the random
colors being displayed while the second will contain a grid view that will have each grid-box contain
all the predefined colors contained in the game... This way the user will be able to choose the next
random color while the color is still being displayed.

Another thing is that there should be a counter to display the number of random color guessed correctly,
if the player reaches a certain score then the player should be able to unlock higher levels in the game.

Finally, there should be a rate this game dialog when the user wants to exit the the game or share
this game on social media profiles
