Task 2

Yes, the view can be implemented.

Below explains how this would be achieved.

In summary, the "View" will be manipulated in the java code to increase in number 
according to the level of difficulties chosen.

Implementation:
First activity: shows the level of difficulties to a user. i.e
		Easy - 3 views
		Medium - 6 views
		Hard - 10 views
For example, when a user clicks on "Easy", it goes to the next (second) activity.

Second activity: displays 3 views with respect to the level chosen from
		the previous activity. While the colors show and animate intervally,
		it come to a halt at a point and asks (by showing a dialog/fragment) 
		the user to guess the next colors to be displayed by showing 
		list of colors to select.
NB: A lighter shade of colors selected would indicate the next colors to be displayed 
at random.

This would work fine for other levels i.e Medium and Hard.
